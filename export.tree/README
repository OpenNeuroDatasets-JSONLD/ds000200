Pre-adolescents Exposure to Manganese

= Project Summary =
The data included in this pilot study are a collection of 14 
pre-adolescents recruited in one of the Italian sites exposed 
to Manganese. The mean age of the two groups was respectively 
14.7 years (s.d.=2.4) and 14.6 years (s.d.= 0.5) with 4 girls 
in the first group and 2 in the second.

The fMRI paradigm included an olfactory stimulation which consisted 
of 12 alternating task-rest blocks of 25 seconds, 10 volumes/block 
(120 volumes) for a total acquisition time of 5 minutes. The MRI 
acquisition protocol included a Coronal T2 FSE (TR/TE  5000/102 
slice thickness 2 mm, no gap) use for the volumetric measurement 
of the olfactory bulb; a time series of 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) 
(TR/TE 2500/50 ms,  28 axial slices, 3.3 mm thickness, 1.1 mm 
inter-slice gap, matrix size  64x64).
